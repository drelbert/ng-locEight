//The Rebuild

//SASS 
    is 
    syntactically awesome style sheets 
        extension of CSS 

    has 
        two syntaxes 
            Sass 
            SCSS 
                will use this one 

                quick intro to SCSS syntax
                    Variables = start w $ sign 

                    Nesting = for writing nested CSS selectors 

                    Mixins = a block of Sass style 

                    Partials = jsut filters with code fragments 

                    Imports = for importing styles from other files 

//Adding home module 
    is 
        about creating views as feature modules
            for lazy loading 
                 and each view will be built as a separate bundle 

                 generated 
                    module home 
                
                next generate 
                    component home 

//Ch8 
    priciple
        is 
            best if components do not know about each other 
            but still can pass data around 


    intercomponent communication 
        was 
            loose coupling components with 
                dependency injection
        
        can also be 
            bindings 
            events 

    Angualar component 
        as a 
        Black Box with outlets 
        @Output
        @Input 

    receiving values from outside world 
        bind producers of values to inputs of the component 
            the component only needs to know how to deal with the values 

    alternatively
        emit events through an output property 


    mediator design pattern 
    is 
        implementing the communication between looely coupled components 

    does 
        ensure the components properly fit together
        given the task  

        user = mediator 
        blocks = components
